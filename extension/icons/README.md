# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the MoodsWeb extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can:

1. Convert the provided `icon.svg` to PNG at different sizes using online tools or image editors
2. Design your own icons representing journaling/reflection (notebook, pen, etc.)
3. Use any 128x128 icon and resize it to the other required dimensions

## Icon Guidelines

- Use clear, recognizable symbols related to journaling or reflection
- Maintain good contrast for visibility in light and dark themes
- Keep the design simple and scalable
- Consider using the MoodsWeb color scheme (blues/purples)

For now, Firefox will use the SVG file as a fallback, but PNG icons are recommended for better compatibility.
